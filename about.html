      <p>
        I build simple yet reliable systems so teams can move faster. My interests sit at the intersection of
        data, operations, and service with an emphasis in helping military connected students and the military community. 
        This site is a small but honest portfolio of what I am building and learning.

        <p>
          I help run events and projects for the student veteran community and keep the moving parts organized. I document steps,
          owners, and deadlines, then convert them into checklists and trackers that reduce guesswork. I write short how to guides
           so new team members can step in with confidence. I also gather and clean data, then present clear summaries and visuals 
           to my team and directors so they can see what is happening and make data driven decisions. My goal is stable processes 
           that hold up during busy weeks.

        <p>
          Coursework I am a senior at Arizona State University majoring in Applied Business and Technology Solutions. My coursework 
          spans computing and information systems with a focus on web fundamentals and practical data tasks. I am building 
          communication and digital business skills through my specializations and project work. Current class: CIS 300.
          Target graduation: Spring 2026.
